      <h2>What is Christmas ?</h2>
      <p>
        Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ,
        observed primarily on December 25 as a religious and cultural
        celebration among billions of people around the world. A feast central
        to the Christian liturgical year, it is preceded by the season of Advent
        or the Nativity Fast and initiates the season of Christmastide, which
        historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth
        Night.Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries,is celebrated
        religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as culturally by many
        non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the holiday season
        organized around it. The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in
        the New Testament, known as the "Nativity of Jesus", says that Jesus was
        born in Bethlehem.

      <h2>Gift giving</h2>
      <p>
        The exchanging of gifts is one of the core aspects of the modern
        Christmas celebration, making it the most profitable time of year for
        retailers and businesses throughout the world. On Christmas, people
        exchange gifts based on the Christian tradition associated with Saint
        Nicholas,and the gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh which were given
        to the baby Jesus by the Magi.The practice of gift giving in the Roman
        celebration of Saturnalia may have influenced Christian customs, but on
        the other hand the Christian "core dogma of the Incarnation, however,
        solidly established the giving and receiving of gifts as the structural
        principle of that recurrent yet unique event", because it was the
        Biblical Magi, "together with all their fellow men, who received the
        gift of God through man's renewed participation in the divine life.

      <h2>Who is Santa ?</h2>
      <p>
        Santa Claus, also known as Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, Saint Nick,
        Kris Kringle, or simply Santa, is a legendary character originating in
        Western Christian culture who is said to bring children gifts on
        Christmas Eve of toys and candy or coal or nothing, depending on whether
        they are "naughty or nice".He is said to accomplish this with the aid of
        Christmas elves, who make the toys in his workshop at the North Pole,
        and flying reindeer who pull his sleigh through the air.The modern
        character of Santa is based on traditions surrounding the historical
        Saint Nicholas, the English figure of Father Christmas and the Dutch
        figure of Sinterklaas.
